<p>You made it another year! Me and Moira and Basil are all very happy for you.<br/> Just because you a mark ass bitch does not mean that we cannot hangout occasionally.<br/> Lets refinish this damn dresser and play some dumb old video games this holiday season. Tell Taylor thanks for taking care of your bitch-ass because lord knows we are not easy people to be around. Love you lots. Here's to another year of E.</p>
